Inefficiency and Route Uncertainty: Users struggle to identify the most efficient, multi-modal route combining various public options (e.g., bus, metro, tram) and walking segments. This leads to longer travel times, missed connections, and relying on multiple, fragmented applications for planning.

Fare Gouging and Cost Anxiety: Public transport fare structures are often complex (zone-based, time-based, transfer fees), non-standardized across operators, and opaque. This uncertainty prevents users from knowing the exact, final cost of their journey upfront, leading to surprise expenses, cost anxiety, and a feeling of being unfairly charged ("fare gouging").

Lack of Real-Time Reliability: Without real-time updates on vehicle locations and delays, users cannot make informed decisions about their route, resulting in wasted waiting time and difficulty adjusting plans during service disruptions.

The goal of the 'Fair Fare' project is to solve these critical pain points by providing a seamless, highly efficient, and transparent platform for urban public transport travel.
